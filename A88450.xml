            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THat your Petitioners are deeply sensible of the many Mercies and signal Providences that these three Nations have received from Almighty God, in subduing his and their Enemies in the times of our late Wars, in which it pleased our wise and Gracious God to use your Highness as the most special and Eminent Instrument in his hand, as chosen out and fitted by him for those great and subsequent works by which his name might be glorified, the three Nations, and in special his own People therein, protected and preserved from their Enemies at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>And not only so, but the continued goodness of God hath followed us, insomuch that after a sharp and bloody War several years together, for some years last past those Clouds have been broken, and the Sun of Peace hath shined upon us with a great measure of hope put into our hearts of a happy, lasting, and well-grounded form of Government, according to the <hi>Petition and Advice</hi> of the late Parliament, consented to by your Highness; for which we do (as in duty bound) bless the Lord, and desire a long and happy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the same.</p>
                        <p>But yet Your Petitioners taking notice from your Highness late gracious Speech to them, That the old rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Enemy is reviving his almost dead hopes of prevailing to execute his wrath and malice against God, your Highness, and the good and peaceful people in the Three Nations, partly from the discontents of a brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Party at home, and especially from the Aids of the Popish inveterate Enemy abroad, and have laid designs to themselves hopeful, by Insurrections from within, and Invasions from without us, to raise new Troubles, and kindle the flames of War again amongst us, by which to change our Government, and therein ruine the Three Nations:</p>
                        <p>The premises considered, Your Petitioners do profess unto All, both Friends and Enemies, That We shall, upon our antient Principles of Love and Fidelity to God, your Highness, and the Good People in the Three Nations, with all readiness oppose this Enemy to the uttermost, with our Lives and Fortunes:</p>
                        <p>And therefore do most humbly pray, That your Highness will please, with all chearfulness, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate, to go on in the Government of these Three Nations, for preservation of Religion, the Laws, Liberties, Peace and Safety thereof. And as your Petitioners do bless God for You, so they shall (as in duty bound) faithfully and constantly, in their several places, not only yield obedience to You therein, but be Enemies to yours and the Nations Enemies, and Friends to yours and the Nations Friends. <hi>And ever pray,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
